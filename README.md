# Python Conferences

Here is a list of [Python Conferences](http://www.pycon.org) around the World.

Each CSV file is [compatible with Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en). If would like to add a conference, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/pulls).

If you are a conference organizer, we can give you direct access to the repository, but it is your responsibility to update your own event! The goal is to make it easier for **speakers, instructors, sponsors** to find your conference. [Open an issue](https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/issues/new?template=request-for-access-as-a-conference-organizer-.md) to get yourself added to the repo.
