# Python Conferences

Here is a list of [Python Conferences](http://www.pycon.org) around the World.

If would like to add a conference, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/pulls).

If you are a conference organizer, we can give you direct access to the repository, but it is your responsibility to update your own event! The goal is to make it easier for **speakers, instructors, sponsors** to find your conference.
